# Only Five Scanner
 The is a pseudo-RSS-Generator that addresses a very specific problem that specific people have/had. This application is a simple HTML parser that looks at the website "Only-Five.jp" and scans the website for product listings of interest.

# Project is dead btw
The site is no longer useful to me, and thusly, there is no point in making sure that this tool still works.
